<h2>Pizza (2 Pizzas)</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>260g Bread Flour</li>
            <li>40g Semolina</li>
            <li>180ml Warm Water</li>
            <li>1 Yeast Sachet</li>
            <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp Sugar</li>
            <li>Â½ tsp Garlic Granules</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Mutti Aromatica Pizza Sauce</li>
            <li>Low Moisture Mozzarella</li>
            <li>1 tsp Italian Seasoning</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let sit for 10 minutes until foamy.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, semolina, salt, and garlic granules, then add the yeast mixture. Mix until a dough forms, then knead for 20 minutes until smooth.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into two equal balls and place each in a lightly oiled bowl. Drizzle a little oil on top to prevent drying, then cover and let rise for at least 1 hour at room temperature or 24+ hours in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to its highest setting with a pizza stone inside for at least 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Dust one dough ball with semolina and stretch it out from the center outward. Spread two spoonfuls of pizza sauce evenly, leaving space for the crust.</li>
            <li>Cut the mozzarella into small cubes, distribute evenly, and sprinkle the Italian seasoning on top.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 10 minutes, turning halfway through, until golden and crispy. Remove from the oven, let cool slightly, then slice and enjoy!</li>
